This project aims to predict flight fares using historical data and various features that influence ticket prices. The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast airfare prices based on factors like airline, source, destination, departure time, arrival time, and duration, among others. Flight fare prediction is a crucial problem in the aviation industry, benefiting both airlines and customers by optimizing costs and offering better deals.

**Problem Statement**
Flight ticket prices fluctuate based on several factors such as demand, time to departure, seasonality, route popularity, and carrier-specific pricing strategies. Predicting the price of a flight helps travelers plan trips more efficiently and can potentially save costs. This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze historical flight data and predict the fare for future flights.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains information on various flight bookings including:

Airline: The airline providing the service.
Source: The departure city or airport.
Destination: The arrival city or airport.
Departure Time: The time of day the flight departs.
Arrival Time: The time of day the flight arrives.
Duration: Total time spent in the air.
Date of Journey: The date of the flight.
Number of Stops: Number of stops during the journey.
Price: The actual fare of the flight (target variable).

**Dataset Preprocessing**
Feature Engineering: Extraction of useful features like day of the week, month, and seasonality from the date of journey, and encoding categorical features like airline and route.
Missing Data Handling: Dealing with any missing or incomplete data points.
Data Normalization: Scaling and normalizing the data to ensure better model performance.

**Models Used**
Several machine learning algorithms were explored to predict flight prices, including:

Linear Regression: A basic regression model to establish a baseline for prediction.
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble learning method that improves accuracy by averaging the results of multiple decision trees.

**Evaluation Metrics**
The models are evaluated using:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): To measure the difference between predicted and actual values.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): To measure the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual prices.
RÂ² Score: To evaluate the goodness of fit of the model.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict flight fares based on historical data and various flight features. By using appropriate regression models and tuning them effectively, it is possible to provide actionable insights into future ticket pricing trends.
